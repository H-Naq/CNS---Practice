## Brain Tumor Segmentation Experiment Introduction

In this experiment, we will be using the BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) brain tumor MRI dataset to explore and evaluate different deep learning approaches for brain tumor segmentation. The goal of this experiment is to develop accurate and efficient models that can automatically identify and segment brain tumors from MRI scans.

The BraTS dataset provides a diverse collection of brain MRI scans, including both low-grade and high-grade gliomas. By leveraging this dataset, we can train and test various deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and U-Net, to perform precise tumor segmentation.

The outcome of this experiment will contribute to the advancement of medical imaging analysis and potentially aid in the diagnosis and treatment planning of brain tumor patients. By accurately segmenting brain tumors, we can assist medical professionals in making informed decisions and improving patient outcomes.

Stay tuned for the results and analysis of our experiments with different DL approaches for brain tumor segmentation.
